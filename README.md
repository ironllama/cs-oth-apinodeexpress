# cs-oth-apinodeexpress

To run the express.js server:
```
node apisrock.js
```

To run the server while editing, it's convenient to use `nodemon`, since it'll automatically restart the server if it detects updates to the file:
```
npx nodemon apisrock.js
```

## Installation
After downloading the repo, don't forget to also download all the required packages, using npm:
```
npm ci
```
